                            The labour market refers to the employers demand for employees time in return for some wage
                            the supply of employees willing to provide their time to work for a wage.

                            Typically, at the Microeconomic level, employers and employees interact with each other through
                            firing, hiring, rising or cutting wages and hours.

                            At a Macroeconomic level, there are a number of forces, domestically and internationall,
                            which affect the conditions of labor markets. Such forces may be attributed by rising population levels,
                            immigration, war, technological advances, and much more.
